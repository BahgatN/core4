job principles
==============

core4 Jobs represent single or multiple Tasks that are to be executed within the Framework.
Jobs give access to the core4 configuration, core4 queue and the database.

.. _philosophy:

With the core automation framework we adhere to the following two design paradigms:

#. **divide and conquer** - objective is always to break down a job into two or more jobs until these become
   simple enough to be solved directly.
#. **do one thing and do it well**

Both guidelines are interrelated. The *dotadiw* (do one thing and do it well) philosophy is borrowed from the general
Unix philosophies. Actually, the design of automation jobs should follow the first four out of nine guidelines.

* **Small is beautiful.**
* **Make each program do one thing well.**
* **Build a prototype as soon as possible.**
* **Choose portability over efficiency.**


Out of experience we would recommend to adhere to the following principles also:

.. _best practices:

#. design your applications with restartability in mind.
#. create Data-Structures that are idempotent on multiple loads of the same data.
#. implement continuity-checks if data is continuos.

explanation
-----------

* **line 8** - all jobs inherit from :class:`core4.queue.job.Job`.
* **line 16** - using crontab syntax this job starts each five minutes.
* **line 17** - if the job fails, then retry another 4 times
* **line 18** - but wait for two minutes before each trial.
* **line 20** - the jobâ€™s ``.execute()`` method is called when compute
  resources are available.
* **line 21** - the RSS feed URL can be configured and defaults to the given
  url
* **line 29** - this is an *INFO* message to core4 central logging system. This
  is the Python Standard logging logger knowing *DEBUG*, *INFO*, *WARNING*,
  *ERROR* and *CRITICAL* level messages.
* **line 30** - use :mod:`requests` to get the feed.
* **line 32** - remove all XML tags and split words. I know you can do better
  with exact parsing of the RSS feed.
* **line 35** - build result using core4's own timestamp, not thinking about
  timezones.
* **line 36** - get list of interest terms from :mod:`core4.config` and search
  ``LIEBE`` and ``HASS`` by default.
* **line 37** - loop all terms of interest,
* **line 38** - and count the number of term occurrences.
* **line 39** - update result dict.
* **line 40** - be verbose in *DEBUG* mode (depends on plugin default
  configuration, here).
* **line 42** - get MongoDB collection term.count. Authorisation and access
  permission management is taken from core4 plugin configuration and the
  security profile of the caller (man or machine).
* **line 43** - insert result into the MongoDB. Note that the job adds some
  extra information for tracking purposes.
