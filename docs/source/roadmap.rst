The Development of core4 will be continued and will roughly follow the roadmap
that will be outlined below.

There won't be any release cycles moving forward, but rather new releases will
be released once they are done. The first bigger release will drop around June.

Current release of core4 is 0.1.0. Release 0.2.0 is planned with the initial
version of the front-end (app framework). The first stable release will be
tagged 0.3.0.

Future work plans include:

- Rate Limiting
- Ad-Hoc Jobs
- Job dependencies
