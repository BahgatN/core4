Core4os Frontends

Core4os Single Page Applications are used for complex frontends with multiple views and components.


Widgets are small programs. These service or auxiliary programs can be, for example, a link list to access your BI applications, a summary of your company's main performance indicators and a gateway to access your raw data. They facilitate access to complex or simple functions.

Widgets can have different states. A normal view and a maximum view that opens in fullscreen when you click on the widget. The normal view often offers only a reduced number of functions or it is just a link to the maximum view of the widget.
