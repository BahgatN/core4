core4 is a data automation, insight extraction and knowledge distribution
platform. It is built in `Python`_. core4 positions itself in the analytics,
data science and artificial intelligence ecosystem fueled by computational
libraries like `Numpy`_, `Pandas`_, and `Scikit-Learn`_. On top of that
a wealth of libraries for visualization, interactive notebooks, and
collaboration packages extend the Python feature space (see David Robinson's
blog posts on `The Incredible Growth of Python`_ and `Why Python is Growing So
Quickly`_).

However these packages do not support the data engineer or data scientist in
workflow automation, insight distribution, collaboration, and packaging.
Instead the Python data and analytics landscape support more the ad hoc
analysis exercise to answer single, specific business questions. Any wider
business application of data automation, insight extraction and delivery is
left to other teams, namly backend developers, frontend developers and system
administrators.

core4 fills this gap as a development and operations framework. It supports
data engineers and data scientists to automate and deploy their data
integration, analysis and insights from development into production and to the
end user of business insights and decision support needs.
