core4 is a data automation, insight extraction and knowledge distribution
platform. It is built in `Python`_. core4 positions itself in the analytics,
data science and artificial intelligence ecosystem fueled by computational
libraries like `Numpy`_, `Pandas`_, and `Scikit-Learn`_. On top of that,
core 4 is utilizing the wealth of libraries for visualization, interactive notebooks, and
collaboration packages brought with the expansive Python feature space.

However these packages do not support the data engineer or data scientist in
workflow automation, insight distribution, collaboration, and packaging.
Instead the Python data and analytics landscape is more focused on the ad hoc
analysis aspect to answer single, specific business questions. If there is a need for
broader business applications consisting of data automation, insight extraction and delivery,
it is usually left to other teams like backend developers, frontend developers and system
administrators.

core4 fills this gap as a development and operations framework. It supports and enables
data engineers and data scientists to automate and deploy their data
integration, analysis and insights. This allows for rapid progress from development
to production. Because of that it will arrive at the end user more quickly, in turn
making more room of supporting needs.
