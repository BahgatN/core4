Introduction

core4 is a data automation, insight extraction and knowledge distribution
platform. It is built in `Python` and positions itself in the analytics,
data science and artificial intelligence ecosystem. This Python ecosystem
is fueled by computational libraries like `Numpy`_, `Pandas`_, `Scikit-Learn`_
and a wealth of libraries for visualization, and interactive notebooks.

However these packages do *not* support the data engineer or data scientist in
workflow automation, insight distribution, collaboration, and packaging.
Instead the Python data and analytics scene is more focused on the ad hoc
analysis aspect to answer single, specific business questions. If there is a
need for broader business applications, it is usually left to other teams like
backend developers, frontend developers and system administrators.

core4 fills this gap as a development and operations framework. It supports
and enables data engineers and data scientists to automate and deploy their
data integration, analysis and insights. This allows for rapid progress from
development to production. Because of that it will arrive at the end user more
quickly, in turn making more room of supporting needs.
