why core4
=========

Core utilises Python, the main reason for that choice is that python is the de facto standard for Business Intelligence
and Data Driven Applications.
Below you'll find three usual applications for core and why core is a good choice in each of them.

data engieering perspective
===========================

Core is the perfect tool for your everyday Data Engineering requirements and needs.

Core uses Python as its core, this allows for an easy and fast way of getting started, due to the accessibility
offered by pythons expansive ecosystem and resources.

It gives you easy to use, but powerful Configuration options, so you can customize it for every conceivable use case.
We use YAML for our configs, this makes them easy to read while still maintaining a high level of readability.

Core enables you to painlessly automate and schedule your work, so you have to spend less time manually executing them
or fiddling with other more complex ways of automation.
Let Core do the work for you.

Another big selling point of why you should use core is the effortlessness with which you can execute your jobs
distributed, unlike other solutions there is almost no overhead required and you don’t need to micromanage every node
in your cluster, but if that’s one of your past time activities, don’t worry, if you really want to you can still do
that to your heart's content.

This all is rounded up by arguably one of the most important parts: The controlling and monitoring.
Core allows you to log the things you’re interested in, on varying levels, depending on what you need in given the moment,
from helpful general information when the jobs are progressing smoothly to everything down to lowest level, including
debug messages, when a job failed.


data science perpective
=======================

Core enables Data Scientists to work more efficiently and to get their needed insights faster.

Core supports the flexibility required for a Data Analyst to get their analyses done more quickly,
this is because core is built on Python, an already well established programming language in the Data Scientist space,
this grants access to a huge eco system of existing libraries, which all have the common goal of making your life easier.

Because we use Python as a foundation and all the perks that come with it, core is familiar to work with and it’s just
as easy to get started with as if it were another python library.
With that in mind, we also built core on the principles of REPL to allow for a already familiar and iterative workflow
to Data Scientists.

Another point why you should consider core as your new go-to Tool for your daily work are the built in R-Jobs,
so it’s even easier to use your existing work you’ve already done in R and port it over to core, so it can run on hardware that
is able to scale to your demands rather than you relying on your local machine.

Core is highly scalable and can support multiple distributed machines,
this enables you to work with Big Data with which you were unable to work with before because of the limitations of your local hardware.

This and more is in summary what core offers you, this all comes with a
relatively low technical hurdle, you don’t have to have a deep technical understanding about the inner workings
of a distributed system to get the most out of core.


business user and application perspective
=========================================

Core allows business of any size to build and deploy all kinds of applications fast and hassle free.

Because core with all of its features enables you to perfectly integrate your agile method of operating into the
developing cycle with that it's possible to employ rapid prototyping for you to get tangible results faster.

With the REST capabilities, tornado and Front End Tool integration that core offers it's easy to make your data available
for other applications.
Due to the nature of core it is unifying Data Science and Business Intelligence into one cohesive package.

A big reason of why you should choose core is the ease of how it enables you to work more efficient and get results
faster and can in turn help to improve your product faster.

conclusion:
=========================================

Core is simple to use and enables collaboration between Teams of Data Scientists, Data Engineers and Business Users.

It allows for surface level knowledge, but offers the ability to dive deep into the technical framework.

And it is very extensible because of the use of python.
