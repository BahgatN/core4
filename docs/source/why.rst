.. todo:: write about the reasons to use core4

data engieering perspective
===========================

Core is the perfect tool for your everyday Data Engineering requirements and needs.

Core uses Python as a Core, this allows for an easy and fast way of getting started, because of the accessibility
offered through pythons expansive ecosystem and resources.

It gives you a easy to use but powerful Configuration, so you can customize it for every conceivable purpose,
we use YAML for our configs, this makes them easy to read while still not getting cluttered.

Core enables you to painlessly automate and schedule your work, so you have to spend less time manually executing them,
let core do the work for you.

Another big selling point of why you should use core is the effortlessness with which you can execute your jobs
distributed, unlike other solutions there is almost no overhead required and you don’t need to micromanage every node
in your cluster, but if that’s one of your past time activities, don’t worry, if you really want to you can still do
that to your heart's content.

This all is rounded up by arguably one of the most important parts: The controlling and monitoring.
Core allows you to log the things you’re interested in, on varying levels, depending on what you need right now,
from helpful information when the jobs are progressing smoothly to everything including debug messages when a job failed.


data science perpective
=======================

Core enables Data Scientists to work more efficiently and get their needed insights faster.

Core supports the flexibility required for a Data Analyst to get their analyses done more quickly,
this is because core is built on Python, an already well established programming language in the Data Scientist space,
this grants access to a huge eco system of existing libraries, which all have the common goal to make your life easier.

Because we use Python as a foundation and all the perks that come with it core is familiar to work with and it’s just
as easy to get started as if it were another python library.

Another point why you should consider core as your new go-to Tool for your daily work are the built in R-Jobs,
so it’s even easier to use your existing work you’ve done in R and port it over to core, so it can run on much
faster hardware than your local machine.

Core is highly scalable and can support multiple distributed machines,
this enables you to work with Big Data with which you were unable to work with before because of the limitations of your local hardware.

This and more is in summary what core offers you, this all comes with a
relatively low technical hurdle, you don’t have to have a deep technical understanding about the inner workings
of a distributed system to get the most out of core.
